# ReboOSt Alpha 2
ReboOSt is a continuation of something I worked on before, ApfelOS.
Just to recap: ApfelOS was created when I was still young and childish. It was kinda crappy in it's own ways.

It's over 1,5 Years ago and I improved a lot in lua, so I decided to give ApfelOS a look and think what I could have done better. I was so satisfied with the ideas that came to my mind, that I began to develope on it again. Now, about a week later or so, I can present to you the first Alpha. 

This Build of ReboOSt in perticular contains the following features:

    A very secure login (SHA-256) with unlimited accounts and 2 Stage user rights
    Change the colors from the OS as much as you want, your free from restrictions
    Mouse File Browser by BigSHinyToys
    Sketch by oeed
    luaIDE by GravityScore
    edit the wallpaper to your needs; every user has it's own
    a little shell overlay to prevent damaging system files & adding additional systemfeatures
    ReboOSt can log panel activity, if wished

*all changes apply for every user and can be changed by every user. changes do not apply for 3rd Party Programs
