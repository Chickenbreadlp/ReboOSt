# ReboOSt Alpha 1
ReboOSt is a continuation of something I worked on before, ApfelOS.
Just to recap: ApfelOS was created when I was still young and childish. It was kinda crappy in it's own ways.

It's over 1,5 Years ago and I improved a lot in lua, so I decided to give ApfelOS a look and think what I could have done better. I was so satisfied with the ideas that came to my mind, that I began to develope on it again. Now, about a week later or so, I can present to you the first Dev Build 0010. It's for testing purposes only but still contains most of the feature from the first Alpha, which I'm planning to release this month.
Please Note, that Build 0010 is beeing displayed as Build 10 inside the About panel.

This Build of ReboOSt in perticular contains the following features:

    A very secure login (SHA-256) with unlimited accounts and 2 Stage user rights
    Change the colors from the OS as much as you want, your free from restrictions*
    Mouse File Browser by BigSHinyToys
    Sketch by oeed
    luaIDE by GravityScore
    edit the wallpaper to your needs; every user has it's own

*all changes apply for every user and can be changed by every user. changes do not apply for 3rd Party Programs
