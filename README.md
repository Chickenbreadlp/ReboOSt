# ReboOSt Beta 1
After a lot of work, ReboOSt can finally go into Beta Stage.
Development on ReboOSt started, when I just wanted to look back on what I did with ApfelOS. I had many Ideas to make ApfelOS even better. I acually Improved it so much, that it had barely a single sign of it's predecessor, and so I released it as something new: ReboOSt.

This Build of ReboOSt in perticular contains the following features:

    A very secure login (SHA-256) with unlimited accounts and 2 Stage user rights and SecurOS (A securety feature which constantly checks if the current user can be verified.)
    Change the colors from the OS as much as you want, your free from restrictions
    Mouse File Browser by BigSHinyToys
    Sketch by oeed
    luaIDE by GravityScore
    edit the wallpaper to your needs; every user has it's own
    a little shell overlay to prevent damaging system files & adding additional systemfeatures
    ReboOSt can log panel activity, if wished
    Always on Clock (an automaticly updating clock)

*all changes apply for every user and can be changed by every user. changes do not apply for 3rd Party Programs
